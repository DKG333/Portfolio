                                        <p>
                                            Hi my name is Dean and I'm currently a Game Developer in the Greater Toronto Area I;m really passionate about  making great games for people to enjoy . It all started for me when I enrolled at triOS College for Game Development
                                            and Design, it was the best decision i ever made.
                                            It was an intense course, i spent and year and a half learning everything
                                            you need to know on how make a game from scratch.
                                            During that
                                            time I've learned a lot. Not only did it give me the knowledge about making video games but it also taught me how to deal with challenge's and how to push through the
                                            Grind. I went from knowing nothing about coding
                                            or designing video games to making some cool fun games for everyone to play. I hope you enjoy playing them just as much i had making them. Do not hesitate to ask any questions. i also have a dedicated blog 
                                            explaining my entire experience at 
                                            triOS College. 
                                            Feel to click on the icon for WordPress and check it out, as you scroll down you can check out my work that I've done myself and created with other classmates. We put together some pretty fun enjoyable games.
                                        </p>

                                    <p>this game i made with one other classmate it took a us a one month to put together this game. </p>
                                    <p>My Responsibilities: Made all the levels for it, i implemented radar sytem where in the game it has different pickups(Health,ammo) and Enemies and the radar sytem tracks it and depending on how close you are to it or how far away they are to you. I did all the animations using mixamo now this was a little tricky because it was the first time i did animations in a 3D eneviroment and tryhing to blend all the animations where you move from right to left fowardf and down it was a challenges but i mange to get it all done. I also made a nav mesh so the enimies can run after you. I also implemented a hit screen so when you get hurt red particles are all over the main camera.  </p>
                                    <p>Overall Experiance: I had a lot of enjoyment buiding this game during the course of the month and it turned out really well. I enjoyed all aspects of this game i always wanted to make a survival horror game.</p>

                                    <p>I did this game myself, it took me a month to build out</p>
                                    <p>My Responsibilities: I made a shop system where once you have click on a turret you can build it on one of the nodes , there able to shoot enemies and you gain money from that and there are different types turrets you can use. Once you have enough money you can upgrade them and you can also sell them for more money, some of the challenges I experience were just making the turrets interact with nodes and able to build them on the nodes, what was also difficult was doing the upgrades .I had a lot of fun when i got to make the turrets shoot at enemies', the more easiest part was the wave system enemies coming after through a waypoints system.</p>
                                    <p>Overall Experience: this game was a big challenge's because it was the first game i had to do myself but i overcame all the challenges' and its a really enjoyable game </p>

                                <p> This game took me Two weeks to create.</p>
                                <p>My Responsibilities: I had a lot of fun making this game because i had some experience making a 2D side roller from previous courses so doing this game wasn't to challenging but i had a little bit of a hard time doing the save state once you completed a level transferring the data over to the next level like how many loves you had as ell as the health. I had a lot of fun making the player move back and fourth doing the animations once he dies i also added a bonus where when you collect the coins(dead State) and collected five of them you got an extra live added. </p>
                                <p>Overall Experience: I had a great time creating this game it wasn't to difficult to make i did have challenges but nothing i couldn't handle. </p>
