                                        <p>
                                            Hi my name is Dean and I'm currently a Game Developer in the Greater Toronto Area I;m really passionate about  making great games for people to enjoy . It all started for me when I enrolled at triOS College for Game Development
                                            and Design, it was the best decision i ever made.
                                            It was an intense course, i spent and year and a half learning everything
                                            you need to know on how make a game from scratch.
                                            During that
                                            time I've learned a lot. Not only did it give me the knowledge about making video games but it also taught me how to deal with challenge's and how to push through the
                                            Grind. I went from knowing nothing about coding
                                            or designing video games to making some cool fun games for everyone to play. I hope you enjoy playing them just as much i had making them. Do not hesitate to ask any questions. i also have a dedicated blog 
                                            explaining my entire experience at 
                                            triOS College. 
                                            Feel to click on the icon for WordPress and check it out, as you scroll down you can check out my work that I've done myself and created with other classmates. We put together some pretty fun enjoyable games.

                                    <p> A 3D unity Game Survival horror.</p> <a href="https://github.com/DKG333/Survive3" Target=_blank>Click Here for Github Repository</a>
                                    <p> I made this with one other classmate it took a us a one month to put together. </p>
                                    <p>My Responsibilities: Made all the levels for it, i implemented radar sytem where in the game it has different pickups(Health,ammo) and Enemies and the radar sytem tracks it and depending on how close you are to it or how far away they are to you. I did all the animations using mixamo now this was a little tricky because it was the first time i did animations in a 3D eneviroment and trying to blend all the animations where you move from right to left foward and down it was a challenge but i was able to push through and get it working for us. I also made a nav mesh so the enimies can run after you. I also implemented a hit screen so when you get hurt red particles appear are all over the main camera.  </p>
                                    <p>Overall Experiance: I had a lot of enjoyment buiding this game during the course of the month and it turned out really well. I enjoyed all aspects of this game i always wanted to make a survival horror game. Feel free to watch some Gameplay.</p>

        <p>a 3D unity Top Down Tower Defense Game <a href="https://github.com/DKG333/TheLastStance" Target=_blank>Click Here for Github Repository</a> </p>
        <p>I did this game myself, it took me a month to build out</p>
        <p>My Responsibilities: I made a shop system where once you have click on a turret you can build it on one of the nodes , there able to shoot enemies and you gain money from that and there are different types turrets you can use. Once you have enough money you can upgrade them and you can also sell them for more money, some of the challenges I experience were just making the turrets interact with nodes and able to build them on the nodes, what was also difficult was doing the upgrades .I had a lot of fun when i got to make the turrets shoot at enemies', the more easiest part was the wave system enemies coming after through a waypoints system.</p>
        <p>Overall Experience: this game was a big challenge's because it was the first game i had to do myself but i overcame all the challenges' and its a really enjoyable game </p>

                                    <p> This game took me Two weeks to create.</p>
                                    <p>My Responsibilities: I had a lot of fun making this game because i had some experience making a 2D side roller from previous courses so doing this game wasn't to challenging but i had a little bit of a hard time doing the save state meaning once you completed a level transferring the data over to the next level like how many lives you had as well as the remainder of your health and the level too. I had a lot of fun making the player move back and fourth doing the animations once he dies i also added a bonus where when you collect the coins(dead State) and collected five of them you got an extra live added. </p>
                                    <p>Overall Experience: I had a great time creating this game it wasn't difficult to make i did have challenges but nothing i couldn't over come. </p>

                                            <p>My Responsibilities: I created all 18 holes(Levels) i Design myself each one is different and unique, I use the XCode editor to create it all. I also put all the colliders on each of the trees the rocks around the whole map and just anything that the ball needed to collide with, so that the ball stays inside the put course at all times. The most challenging part for myself was the swing count i had to implemented it so that every time the user swings the ball the counter keeps tracks of it. I also did put colliders with each of the holes so once the ball reaches it, you were able to move on to the next level. </p>
                                            <p>Overall Experience: I had a great time designing all the levels it took me some time to write it all down but after doing so I gain more confidence on level design. </p>

                                        <p> This Game was made by Myself and two other classmates it took us 3 weeks to create.</p>
                                        <p>My Responsibilities: I created the menu system in this game including when the player dies and you have to go back to the main menu and i help out with movement code a bit the most challenging part for me was doing the functionality where you have to click to go back to main because it was my first time using java to create a game but it logically things are the same just the syntax once i figured that out i was able to make it work. our game is unique in a way where typically infinite runner games you have the player moving but in this game we have so that the [layer is standing still and objects are coming after you and have to quickly dodge before they hit you and as time goes up the objects are faster and faster.      </p>
                                        <p>I had great time working with my team and coming up with ideas how this game should be played. It took a little bit of time time to planned out the specifications of exactly what functionality we need to create it, once had that all map out it went smoothly.  </p>

                                        <p>My Responsibilities: The most difficult part was creating a inventory system having a container and store all the data and as you go you can pick up objects as well you can discard them. I had a great time implementing a battle system once you encounter an enemy you can actually battle them and they can damage you as well you can damage them. I wrote the whole story for the user to feel like there that there actually there. </p>
                                        <p>Overall Experience: After making this game i gain more confidence in my story telling capabilities as well as coding all the different parts of the game it was my first C++ project and after doing this game i understand a lot better what C++ is and it can do. </p>

                                    <p>A maze That has obstacles to avoid </p>
                                    <p> This game was done in javascript using phaser. Myself and two other classmates did this.</p>
                                    <p>My Responsibilities: My part was to create and level and have the user go through the different obstacles and trying to collect coins at the same time. it was a little difficult trying to code out the obstacles m,moving up and down and positioning them correctly. When i had to code out for the user to pick up the coin's it was easier for to do that.</p>
                                    <p>Overall Experience: I definitely gained a lot more knowledge about JavaScript and how to make games for the web.</p>
